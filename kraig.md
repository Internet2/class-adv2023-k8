### Deploy a Jupyterhub with scalable compute nodes on multiple cloud platforms by Feb 14th.

### Usage

[Will provide a link to the terraform script]

### Acknowledgments

This project was created as part of the Internet2 CLASS Advanced program and supported with credits from AWS, GCP, and Azure.

### Personal Goals:

My personal goal is to write my own terraform script to be able to deploy the resources necessary to complete this project.

To Do:

- [x] Deploy a Kubernetes cluster on GCP
- [x] Create a [README.md](http://README.md) for team github
- [ ] Install Jupyter notebook to AWS cluster
- [ ] Register domain with GCP cloud domains
- [ ] Point Jupyterhub instance to new domain
- [ ] Setup SSL Certificate
- [ ] Setup OAuth
- [ ] Create a Terraform deployment
- [ ] Upload to GitHub
- [ ] Stress-test the application
- [ ] Setup autoscaling

### Personal Deliverables:

- Jupyterhub test application running on AWS
- Terraform code to reproduce the setup
