<h2>Group project goals</h2>

1. Learn how create replicable and reusable templates for deployment of cloud services using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), namely Terraform
2. Understand how to use Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling of microservices
3. Understand how to deploy scalable Jupyterhubs (i.e. Jupyterhubs as a service, Jupyterhub for Classroom)
4. Understand best practices on Jupyterhub deployments including steps on SSO/OAuth, cost optimization, security, networking, and other node scaling mechanisms
5. Learn Github as a collaborative tool!

Presentation sequence:
1. Overview of project goals
2. Demo of AWS deployment using Terraform 
3. Demo of Azure deployment using Terraform
4. Demo of GCP deployment using Terraform (maybe unnecessary)
5. Brief overview of lessons learned re: Security
6. Brief overview of lessons learned re: Networking
7. Jupyterhub + NFS (why, how)
8. Demo of functional Jupyterhub - let's crash the thing and watch it autoscale
